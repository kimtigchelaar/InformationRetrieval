# InformationRetrieval
Information retrieval project where a search engine was built. The goal of the project was to learn how to work with large amounts of textual data (i. e. Word2Vec models and word embedding), being able to process it efficiently and apply ranking algorithms to answer queries. 
Algorithms used: TF-IDF, Query Likelihood, Smooth Query Likelihood and BM25.
